# React SSR starter template
This is a starter template for SSR.

SSR is a technique used to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client. Normally, React renders components on the client side, but with SSR, the initial rendering happens on the server.

This can be beneficial for a few reasons:

Improved SEO: Search engines often have a hard time indexing content generated by client-side JavaScript. With SSR, the server sends fully-rendered HTML to the client, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index.

Faster Initial Page Load: With SSR, users receive a pre-rendered page from the server, reducing the time it takes to load the initial content. This can result in a faster perceived page load time.

Accessibility: Some users may have slow or unreliable network connections or disabled JavaScript. SSR ensures that these users still get a meaningful content load.
